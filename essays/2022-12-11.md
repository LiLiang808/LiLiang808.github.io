   The pandemic have been 3 year since started, I finished my software enginerring 1 while the pandemic. Unlike Software Engineering 1, in Software Engineering 2 we did not spend much time on meeting in discord, and instead we spent much of our time in group meetings in person and worked for the project. Not like the project from software engineering 1, we were no longer able to pick our own topic but instead the DOE gave us a project relate to the legislation system. Unlike the project we had in ICS 414, this project actually apply in the real work situation.

## Coding Review
  Easily one of the most useful, early and reliable skills sets to master. In my opinion, fundamentally the parts to work on. It helps to stomp out bad habits, reworks on structuring, rephrasing, and readability. Coding standards are like an English writing format, in which we follow the rules to keep things simplified and easy to find. Others may disagree but I can see it somewhat similar to MLA and APA formats in an essay. The more consistent your codes are with the standards of the language of your choosing, the easier it is to review it and rewrite the code. Setting these standards for yourself also gives you a minimum you want to give yourself to work on. This will probably help me in the future by teaching me a rigorous way for me to keep a tidy formatting of whatever it is I do in the future. This portion teaches me self discipline and I am grateful for that.

## Oroject-Base Course
   Our final projects received an abundance of feedback from my friends and group mates alike. Something I feel I should reflect on because in a way this is like coding standards, a core mechanic on organizing. Where coding standards are for formatting, design patterns are the bread and butter in problem solving techniques. Honestly sometimes I fear I may rely on this too much in the future. It almost feels like a cheat code to use for almost all purpose, problem solving string of codes that identify most of the underlying issues with my code. Still, making use of this and working with this in mind is crucial for tidy, and legible lines of code.

## Satisfying Client Demands
   I was not sure if we were gonna cover this in the course, but I am grateful that we did. Open source coding is a godsend for me. I download emulators for games, specific mods for games, and even school work help from open source, â€˜specially from places like github. I really enjoyed learning about the freedoms and limitations of open sourcing codes. I really like the fact that we have all these generous people that are willing to share codes, projects, and ideas via platforms like GitHub and SourceForge. From what I learned, it was an idea formed to ignore all these annoying restrictions, and not willing to be selfish with copyright holds.
