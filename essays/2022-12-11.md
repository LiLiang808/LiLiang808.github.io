   The pandemic have been 3 year since started, I finished my software enginerring 1 while the pandemic. Unlike Software Engineering 1, in Software Engineering 2 we did not spend much time on meeting in discord, and instead we spent much of our time in group meetings in person and worked for the project. Not like the project from software engineering 1, we were no longer able to pick our own topic but instead the DOE gave us a project relate to the legislation system. Unlike the project we had in ICS 414, this project actually apply in the real work situation.

## Coding Review
  Code Review is one of the new concept in this class, more close to real coding environment and wordkplace. Instead worked with other 3 people, we had 9 people in the group project. It is a new experience for me to work with so many people. Since we were working together this semester, the biggest chanllenge we faced in this class was creating a meeting time to time. Luckily, the class is in person, so everyone are basically will be in class and no one is not in Hawaii. However, many of us stil have job and some family issues during the semester, we barely can't find a good time to make sure everyone are available. We still had class meeting on Tuesday and Thursday weekly that can discuss about the progress of the project for each one.

## Large Group Project
  Instead worked with other 3 people in software engineering 1, we had 9 people in the group project. It is a new experience for me to work with so many people. Since we were working together this semester, the biggest chanllenge we faced in this class was creating a meeting time to time. Luckily, the class is in person, so everyone are basically will be in class and no one is not in Hawaii. However, many of us stil have job and some family issues during the semester, we barely can't find a good time to make sure everyone are available. We stil had class meeting on Tuesday and Thursday weekly that can discuss about the progress of the project for everyone. Most of the time, we communicated via discord and solve many of the issues together which make us learned a lot from helping each other. We also have two excellent leader in this project to help us organize the work and helped us on the issues that we were challenged. Through this ecperience in the class I learned how agile prohect management and effective communication between members could help me how to work better in the project with a larger group. These will be a great impact for me to work with my co-worker in the furture.

## Satisfying Client Demands
   I was not sure if we were gonna cover this in the course, but I am grateful that we did. Open source coding is a godsend for me. I download emulators for games, specific mods for games, and even school work help from open source, â€˜specially from places like github. I really enjoyed learning about the freedoms and limitations of open sourcing codes. I really like the fact that we have all these generous people that are willing to share codes, projects, and ideas via platforms like GitHub and SourceForge. From what I learned, it was an idea formed to ignore all these annoying restrictions, and not willing to be selfish with copyright holds.
