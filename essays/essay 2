## Interest

I guess I’ve always had an interest in computers and electronics, and the passion carried over for computer programming, and from a naive and young dream of trying to be like a ‘hacker’ for a job. While that may be a career choice that will not have any fruition, I still want to learn how computers work, to do a few things for myself. First I’d like to learn how to program, in case I want to toy with my own electronics. It's kind of like how an average American dad would like to be better at construction related jobs, to do some DIY projects, and maybe fix their own houses without paying someone to do it for them. Secondly, I think I simply want to understand what makes a computer work, the dramas and TV shows and movies don't exactly give me a good idea how people can do such wonderful or devious things with a click of a few buttons. My interests kind of changed from wanting to design games, to wanting to design… websites to actually use, or sell. I’m not exactly sure what I want to do with this passion, as it is evolving and changing everyday.
