## Experiences
  I have tried coding before but never in an intensive course at this college level, I do plan on making coding a part of my career but undecided on how much it will affect my life, I have had interests for a few years since highschool, and I heard Java was a pretty ‘standard’ coding language, so while I may be half a beginner I do feel confident, doing a standard language, versus a few others that are challenging to new students like C++, I have considered Python and a few others, but i feel Java seems like the way to go for now. 
## Career
  I will probably use these skills toward software engineering, alongside some hobbies down the road. Knowing how important computers are, I want to at least figure out the basics, should I ever develop any macros, mods for games, a script, filters, and etc (and not limited to hacking). 
Learning
	So far the WOD’s are quite helpful to me. At the very least it forces me to keep practicing, I know I will sooner or later have days where my motivation is at an all time low, and need something to keep me going. Also the existence of such practices help make sure I get the basics down, and jog my mind, when it comes to anything related to the work I’ve done so far. To me, practice problems, workouts, they all help keep me entertained, while giving me slight challenges, that get increasingly difficult, and hopefully increasingly eventful. Coding and the WOD’s will probably be extremely stressful for just about anyone, I have seen posts and comments about coding languages that make people pull their hairs out. My favorite post so far has to be the: give a code to a man, frustrate him for a day, teach him how to code, frustrate him for a lifetime, an altercation from the famous teach a man how to fish. I have just begun coding, I can’t fathom the stresses that will take place trying to find a single error, in lines of texts.
## Athletic Software Engineering
  I don’t have much knowledge on what athletic software engineering is, quite frankly I think what I know of it so far might be wrong, so I cannot comment on it as much, I will try to learn more about it.
