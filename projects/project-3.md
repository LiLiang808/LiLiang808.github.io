I was so gald that I studied computer science in UHM. I never thought that I can be a student of UHM since I am not really good at studying. However, I am one of them now. This is my first project in ICS11, also is my starting point of learning computer science. And this is a simple program to run a paint sprayer. It definitely easy to understand for every. What I need to do is write a code to move the paint sprayer and spray it where I click, it can also switch to other color. Simple and easy. This is a significant project for me. I will do better on this. Thank you!!!

You can watch the video to see how I run the project [Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z0l2N1AEBj8)
