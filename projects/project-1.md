Tic-tac-toe, noughts and crosses, or Xs and Os is a paper-and-pencil game for two players, X and O, who take turns marking the spaces in a 3Ã—3 grid. The player who succeeds in placing three of their marks in a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal row is the winner. This is the final project for my group in ICS 111. In this project, the player will fight against with the computer. The hardest part in this project is the movement setting, the computer can't not play the step as we set up before. So we use the simplest thinking in the code that make sure it can analyze the possibility of each step. however, the player still have big possiblity to won this game since we didn't do algorithms in our project. It was fun to work for this project with my friends and this is also a starting point to me to learn coding.

```js
byte ADCRead(byte ch)
{
    word value;
    ADC1SC1 = ch;
    while (ADC1SC1_COCO != 1)
    {   // wait until ADC conversion is completed   
    }
    return ADC1RL;  // lower 8-bit value out of 10-bit data from the ADC
}
```
