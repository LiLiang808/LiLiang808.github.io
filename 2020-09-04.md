## Interest
 I guess I’ve always had an interest in computers and electronics, and the passion carried over for computer programming, and from a naive and young dream of trying to be like a ‘hacker’ for a job. While that may be a career choice that will not have any fruition, I still want to learn how computers work, to do a few things for myself. First I’d like to learn how to program, in case I want to toy with my own electronics. It's kind of like how an average American dad would like to be better at construction related jobs, to do some DIY projects, and maybe fix their own houses without paying someone to do it for them. Secondly, I think I simply want to understand what makes a computer work, the dramas and TV shows and movies don't exactly give me a good idea how people can do such wonderful or devious things with a click of a few buttons. My interests kind of changed from wanting to design games, to wanting to design… websites to actually use, or sell. I’m not exactly sure what I want to do with this passion, as it is evolving and changing everyday.

 ## Skills
 It may not be a feasible goal for the short term, but I like to think that, a solid goal of mine that would never change -which will fuel my passion and guide my skill sets- is to develop a page like Google. Now, I don't need it to be just as successful, or have as many features like Google, but I do like the idea of making something useful online that I can be proud to share with the world. Maybe I’ll have a quality of life string of code that will help people reorganize their data or photos, make an AI to help people simplify everyday life like an autocorrect, autofocus photos, antivirus, something I can sell and/or use. Or I could just pick up my old dreams and start developing a game, but instead of the creationist and ideal team sides, I could do the debugging and coding roles. 

 ## Future
  I do hope to gain experiences in fields I have listed above, I don't exactly know how, but I do hope there will be classes for me to take, or any apprenticeships for it. Generally speaking, anything that will teach me how to make a wikipedia, browser, operating system like Linux Windows AppleOS and Android. Anything that will give me the layout and basics to take on jobs for making a script, AI, web security, and anything I may stumble upon as interesting to take up. No direct path for me as of now, just to learn the basics of everything, until I have decided in my heart, the path that is right for me.
